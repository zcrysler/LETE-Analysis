# A walk through the use of R for Motus automated radio-telemetry data  {-}

Our goal with this online 'handbook' is to show Motus (<https://motus.org>) users how to use the R statistical programming language (<https://www.r-project.org/>) to import tag detections data for a project or receiver; clean data and filter false positives; explore detections data through visualizations and summaries; transform the data, e.g., by determining time since sunrise/sunset or magnetic declination; and run various analytical procedures. We hope the contents will be of use, and if you have suggestions for additional examples, please let us know by emailing motus@birdscanada.org.
