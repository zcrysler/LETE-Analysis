<p>In 2018, again only one individual was detected outside the immediate tagging region (Motus tag ID 28520), all other individuals and the bulk of the detections occurred at <em>Exxon Fields</em>, <em>East Grand Terre</em>, and <em>Grand_Isle</em>. Note that in 2018 no birds were detected at <em>Wisner</em> despite close proximity to nesting areas. Based on receiver performance outputs, this is likely due to receiver functionality rather than a true lack of detections. <a href="Results.html#fig:2018DetectionMap">Figure 2.5</a> shows a map of detection pattern of all 2018 tagged birds, while <a href="Results.html#fig:2018LongitudePlots">figure 2.6</a> displays the same data as individual tag plots of latitude vs. time.</p>

A higher signal strength correlates to a stronger detection. Note x and y scales vary between plots.
</p>
</div>
<p><a href="Results.html#fig:incubatingBirds">Figure 2.7</a> is a selection of 4 representative detection patterns of individuals; examining the signal strength it is not always clear when birds are attending the nest site and when they are foraging. For example, tag 23219 shows clear daily signal strength patterns, with low signal strength occurring overnight when the bird is likely incubating. Tag 23218 has a similar but less distinct pattern; some nights the bird is detected while other nights it is not. In other cases the tag is picked up far less consistently as in tag 28593, and in even more extreme cases as in tag 28522. For these final two tags, the bird is rarely if ever detected while incubating, and most detections likely occur as the bird is leaving or arriving at the nest site.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even tags with clear daily detection patterns as in tag 23219, shorter nest site attendance periods during the day are not as obviously picked up. However, based on these detections, the signal strength during incubation is generally much lower than during flight. This is to be expected as a tags detection range increases substantially when a bird is in the air as compared to on the ground (low signal strength = weaker detection). Therefore, all detections on the Exxon Fields receiver with a signal strength &lt; 80 will be excluded from foraging analysis from this point forward to exclude likely detections on the nest during incubation. While this will invariably also remove detections on Exxon Fields that may occur when the bird is in flight, since the station is in very close proximity to the nesting site, in most cases this will only remove the tail ends of a detection streak as the bird is departing or approaching the nesting site.</p>

For each station the total number of visits was calculated (<a href="Results.html#fig:visitFrequency">figure 2.8</a>), as expected <em>Exxon Fields</em> had by far the highest number of visits as it was at the nesting area. In 2017 and 2018 <em>Grand_Isle</em> had the next highest frequency of detections, this is not surprising as it is the closest station to the nesting area (see <a href="Results.html#tab:distanceTable">table 2.1</a>). <em>East Grand Terre</em> and <em>Wisner</em> followed with lower numbers of site visits and are also near the nesting area. Note the lack of detections at <em>Wisner</em> in 2018, this is likely due to receiver malfunction rather than a true lack of detections. All other stations had negligible (&lt;3) visits and are substantially farther away from the nesting grounds.

The length of visits was consistent with the number of visits, that is, birds generally had longer detection periods at <em>Exxon Fields</em>, followed by <em>East Grand Terre</em>, <em>Grand_Isle</em>, and <em>Wisner</em>, only <em>Grand_Isle</em> and <em>Exxon Fields</em> differed significantly in their visit length. <a href="Results.html#fig:visitLength">Figure 2.9</a> shows the mean length of time each bird was detected at each station during each visit (See <a href="AppendixC.html#AppendixC">Appendix C</a> for complete visit information).

</p>
</div>
<p>Of the birds that were detected at <em>Exxon Fields</em> in 2017 and 2018, all were detected on at least 6 different visits. At <em>Grand_Isle</em>, the majority (39/44, 88.6%) of birds were detected on more than 2 separate occasions (&gt;2 discrete visits). In comparison, at the remaining stations less than half (10/23, 43.5%) were detected on more than two occasions. Only tag 23261 appeared semi-regularly at <em>Wisner</em> but is notable in 12 detections.</p>
<p>Thus birds appear to spend the majority of their time in close proximity to <em>Exxon Fields</em>, however this could be a by-product of increased detection due to proximity to nesting sites and therefore a necessity to frequently pass the receiver regardless if foraging is occurring nearby or not. Most birds frequented <em>Grand_Isle</em> regularly which could be due to nearby foraging, or a proximity to the nesting site.</p>
<div id="simultaneous-detections" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Simultaneous Detections</h3>
<p>If stations are within close proximity of one another, it’s possible to get simultaneous detections on both stations at once. During incubation there were 161 pairs of simultaneous detections, 2 of these occurred between <em>East Grand Terre</em> and <em>Exxon Fields</em>, 3 between <em>East Grand Terre</em> and <em>Grand_Isle</em>, and the other 156 between <em>Exxon Fields</em> and <em>Grand_Isle</em>. <em>Exxon Fields</em> and <em>Grand_Isle</em> are the closest two stations at 3.1 km apart, easily within range of each other particularly when birds are in flight (see <a href="AppendixB.html#AppendixB">Appendix B</a>). <em>East Grand Terre</em> is 12.6 km and 15.8 km away from <em>Exxon Fields</em> and <em>Grand_Isle</em> respectively, the next closest pairs of stations.</p>
</div>
<div id="detection-directions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Detection Directions</h3>
<p>We can narrow down the areas visited beyond which site they were detected at by examining which antenna they were detected on. Figures <a href="Results.html#fig:detBearings2017">2.10</a> and <a href="Results.html#fig:detBearings2018">2.11</a> show the total number of detections for each antenna bearing at each site for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Orange lines indicate the antenna bearings at each site, the blue bars are coloured by the number of detections on each antenna throughout the incubation period - note that scales differ by site.</p>

<p>Detection patterns are similar at <em>Exxon Fields</em>, <em>Grand_Isle</em>, and <em>East Grand Terre</em> in 2017 and 2018. Detections at <em>Exxon Fields</em> were predominantly to the SW, directly in line with the tagging area, this also indicates that birds likely arrive and depart to/from the nesting location from the SW. <em>Grand_Isle</em> detections were overwhelmingly more prevalent to the NE, pointing towards the nearby colony, while this may indicate that birds don’t spend much time foraging to the SW, it could also be due to the sheer proximity of the nesting site. As discussed earlier, nearly all cases of simultaneous detections between two stations occur between <em>Exxon Fields</em> and <em>Grand Isle</em>, suggesting that many of the arrival and departure flights from the colony could be captured by both stations, resulting in the high number of NE detections at Grand Isle being an artifact of colony attendance. <em>East Grand Terre</em> had the most detections by far to the SW, again towards the colony.</p>
<p>In 2017, birds were picked up in very small numbers outside of the immediate breeding area. It is difficult to make generalized assumptions from such a small number of detections, however it does seem as though a few birds may be using the areas off the coast around <em>Quintana</em>. There are even fewer detections away from the colony during incubation in 2018, but those that do occur are in the same region.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Mean Distances Travelled for Foraging</h2>
<p>Based on detection data, in 2017 the mean distance travelled for all detection periods was 2.5km, with a maximum distance travelled to <em>San Bernard NWR (Big Pond Unit)</em> at 569.1 km. In 2018 the mean distance travelled was 0.86 km, with a maximum distance travelled of 464.1 km to <em>Bolivar Flats</em>. However, the vast majority of detections (4,366/4,374 or 99.8%) during foraging trips occurred within 23.1 km from the colony detected at the four closest receiver stations (<em>Exxon Fields</em>, <em>Grand_Isle</em>, <em>East Grand Terre</em>, and <em>Wisner</em>).</p>
